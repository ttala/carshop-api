# Carshop API

In this project, I built a lightweight CI/CD pipeline to deploy a FastAPI application on Kubernetes, with automated delivery managed by ArgoCD.
The application ingests a store.csv file into a PostgreSQL database, which then serves as the sample dataset for API queries.

## Running the Project

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ttala/carshop-api.git
```
